## Why

Current client logos section displays 6 logos (IKN, PLN, Pertamina, Narasi, M Corp, Pentacity) but needs to be updated with new/different client logos to reflect current partnerships and maintain credibility with fresh client references.

## What Changes

- Replace or add new client logo images in `/public/clients/` directory
- Update HTML references in client logos section to display new logos
- Maintain existing infinite scroll animation and grayscale hover effects
- Optimize new logo images to WebP format for performance
